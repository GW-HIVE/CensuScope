# CensuScope

What is CensuScope?
------------------------
CensuScope is designed for the quick detection of the components in a given NGS metagenomic dataset. It can provide users with a standard format report of components into species or higher taxonomic node resolution.

The core of CensuScope consists of census-based reads file generation and Blast/bowtie based short-reads alignment. 
CensuScope is capable of sample contamination evaluation, microbiome components detection and other meta-omic related data analysis.
